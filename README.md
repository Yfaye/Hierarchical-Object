Hierarchical Object Motion Control System

This project is to implement a system to generate the motion of an articulated figure. The figure should consist minimally of a torso and two legs. The motion generated should be a simple walking motion along trajectory given by control points. The procedures to generate the leg motion is sinusoidal interpolation.
